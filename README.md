# etch-a-sketch
This project helped me improve my skills in DOM manipulation and working with events in JavaScript. Specifically, I learned:

Dynamically creating HTML elements with JavaScript: I learned how to generate and manipulate divs programmatically to build a customizable grid.
CSS Flexbox: I used Flexbox to create a responsive grid layout, avoiding the need for traditional grid systems.
Event Handling in JavaScript: I gained experience adding event listeners to elements and responding to user interactions like mouse hover and button clicks.
JavaScript Functions and Logic: I implemented functions for handling dynamic changes, such as generating a new grid or changing square colors.
By working through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how to manipulate the DOM and handle user input, making my web development skills stronger.
